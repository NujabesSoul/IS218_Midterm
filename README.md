# IS218 Midterm
For your project you are required to make a program that can read and write records to a CSV file.   It should demonstrate a MVC style design pattern through the creation of a single index page that can be used to route pages based on URL parameters as demonstrated in class.

The default page should be the list of records and there should be a link to the page to add new records.

Your program should consist of three pages:

    Page 1 - HTML form with fields for (First Name, Last Name, and Email Address.  This page should have a submit button and should be used to add records to the csv file

     2.  Page 2 - HTML Table view that displays the First Name, Last Name and Email address of everyone in the CSV and an edit button next to EACH record that links to an edit form for that record.  

     3.  Page 3 - HTML edit form that has a submit button to save the changes, and a delete button to delete the record.

    Demonstrates a factory pattern  - 20 Points
    Demonstrates a controller pattern – 20 Points
    Page 1, 2, and 3 work – 20 Points per page
